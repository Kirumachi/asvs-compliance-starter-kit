# ASVS Compliance Starter Kit

Welcome! This repository provides a set of adaptable templates and documentation based on the **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) 5.0**. Our goal is to offer a practical framework that helps engineering teams of all sizes embed security into their development process from the start.

This is a public, open-source project, free for anyone to use and adapt. We welcome contributions to help make it a valuable resource for the entire community. By using this kit, teams can effectively "shift-left," ensuring security is considered at every stage of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and empowering them to build secure products by design.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

* **`/00-Documentation-Standards/`**: Contains high-level policy and decision templates. These are meant to be completed during the design and threat modeling phases of a project.
* **`/01-ASVS-Core-Reference/`**: Houses our organization's official, tailored version of the ASVS 5.0 standard in machine-readable formats (JSON, CSV). This is the baseline against which all applications are measured.
* **`/02-Implementation-Guidance/`**: Provides practical, developer-focused guidance, including approved libraries, secure coding patterns, and example verification tests for specific ASVS requirements.
* **`/03-Product-Specific-Files/`**: A placeholder for teams to link to or store their product-specific ASVS documentation, such as threat models or completed decision templates.
* **`/04-Documentation-Artifacts/`**: A central location for storing signed-off or critical security decision artifacts for archival and audit purposes.

## How to Use This Framework

### For Product & Engineering Leads

1.  **Define Your Target:** Start in `/00-Documentation-Standards/Level-Definitions.md` to understand which ASVS level applies to your application.
2.  **Document Key Decisions:** Use the templates in `/00-Documentation-Standards/Decision-Templates/` during the design phase to document critical security architecture choices (e.g., authentication strategy, data classification).

### For Developers

1.  **Understand Requirements:** Refer to the baseline files in `/01-ASVS-Core-Reference/` to see the specific controls required for your application's ASVS level.
2.  **Find Secure Solutions:** Before implementing a security feature (like CSRF protection or password hashing), check `/02-Implementation-Guidance/` for approved patterns and libraries for your language stack.

### For Security & QA Teams

1.  **Automate Verification:** Use the JSON files in `/01-ASVS-Core-Reference/` as input for security testing tools and scripts.
2.  **Write Test Cases:** Use the guidance in `/02-Implementation-Guidance/Verification-Tests/` to create effective unit, integration, and security tests that map directly to ASVS requirements.

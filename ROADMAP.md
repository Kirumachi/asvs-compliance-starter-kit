# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level goals and future direction for the ASVS Compliance Starter Kit. Our vision is to make this the most practical, developer-friendly resource for operationalizing the ASVS.

## Short-Term Goals (v1.1)

Our immediate focus is on enriching the existing content and making the kit more comprehensive.

- [ ] **Expand Implementation Guidance:** Add more secure coding patterns to the `/02-Implementation-Guidance/` directory for common vulnerabilities (e.g., Secure Password Storage, Input Validation, Secure File Uploads).
- [ ] **Add More Decision Templates:** Create new templates in `/00-Documentation-Standards/Decision-Templates/` for other key ASVS chapters (e.g., V5 File Handling, V11 Cryptography).
- [ ] **Provide Verification Examples:** Populate the `/02-Implementation-Guidance/Verification-Tests/` directory with examples of how to write unit or integration tests for specific ASVS requirements.
- [ ] **Improve Automation Scripts:** Develop simple scripts to help users generate checklists from the core JSON/CSV files.

## Medium-Term Goals (v1.2)

- [ ] **Language-Specific Guidance:** Create dedicated sections for popular languages (e.g., Python, Java, Go, C#) with framework-specific advice.
- [ ] **Integration with Tooling:** Provide examples or scripts for integrating the machine-readable ASVS files with common security tools (e.g., DAST scanners, SAST linters).
- [ ] **Threat Modeling Content:** Add templates and guidance for conducting lightweight threat modeling exercises that map to ASVS controls.

## Long-Term Vision (v2.0 and beyond)

- [ ] **Interactive Tooling:** Explore the possibility of a web-based tool that allows users to select their project's ASVS level and generate a tailored set of documentation and checklists.
- [ ] **Community Case Studies:** Feature case studies or examples from users who have successfully implemented the starter kit in their organizations.
